# AVR ISP to PIN6 2.54mm and 1.27mm adapter board

This adapter board is very useful if you use AVRâ€™s with breadboards or you want to program AVRs on smaller SMD boards.

The common 10-pin ISP jack is connected to the smaller 6-pin array - a standard 2.54mm pin array and to a 1.27mm pin array for SMD boards. You can insert the 2.54mm 6-pin inline connector directly into a breadboard.

### Circuit schematics

The adapter is compatible with the [SparkFun AVR Programming Adapter](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8508) (sku BOB-08508). The SMD connector differs to the pinout from the 2.54mm 6-pin array, to be compatible with the SparkFun AVR SMD programming adapter.

### Eagle library parts

When designing your AVR board, you can take the 1.27mm ISP adapter definition from the SparkFun Eagle Library [SparkFun.lbr](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Library) available at GitHub.

The 1.27mm 6-pin SMD ISP connector is called "AVR_PROGMINISMD" in SparkFun.lbr. You can add the part to your Eagle schematics with the following command:

```
add AVR_PROGMINISMD
```

The 2.54mm 6-pin ISP connector part is called "PINHD-1X6" (or "PINHD-1X6/90" for the rotated version) in the Eagle pinhead.lbr. You can add the part to your Eagle schematics with the following command:

```
add PINHD-1X6
```
