# ATmega8 LED blink SMD test board

This is the SMD version of the ATmega8 LED blink test board. This board is very useful if you want to get started with programming AVRâ€™s.

The board contains two LEDs, which can then be controlled in your C program. See [avr/m8-led-blink](../../../../tree/master/m8-led-blink) for the C source code "main.c".

### Circuit schematics

The board's ATmega8 is connected to the board components as follows:

* LED1 - ATmega8 PD5
* LED2 - ATmega8 PD6
