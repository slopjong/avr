# ATmega8 LED blink test board

This board is very useful if you want to get started with programming AVRâ€™s.

The board contains two LEDs, which can then be controlled in your C program. See [avr/m8-led-blink](../../../../raw/master/m8-led-blink) for the C source code "main.c".

### Circuit schematics

The board's ATmega8 is connected to the board components as follows:

* LED1 - ATmega8 PD5
* LED2 - ATmega8 PD6
